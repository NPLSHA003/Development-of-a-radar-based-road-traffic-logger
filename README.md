# Development-of-a-radar-based-road-traffic-logger

This repositroy contains the code for the preprocessing and proccessing system of the road traffic logger. It further contains all the datasets that were measured using the MIT Coffee Can radar.

In order to run the code all the MATLAB programs should be downloaded. The WAV file you wish to process should also be downloaded. Make sure that all of these are in the same folder. One can then open up the file called processing_recordings, insert the WAV file name and a Spectrogram with the vehicle being dected will be displayed as well as the average speed on the Road traffic logger as a subplot.
